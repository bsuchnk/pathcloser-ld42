A game created in 48h for the Ludum Dare 42 gamejam *(August 2018)*.

Game page: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/42/pathcloser

NOTE: The program uses old SFML version and needs some dlls, which I've not included in the repository. If you want to play the compiled game, download it from the link above.
